For the final project of my artificial intelligence course in Winter 2021, I programmed a 
<a target = '_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search'> Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</a> algorithm for the board game
<a target = '_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago'> Pentago</a>. The MCTS algorithm is designed to find the best move in games with a very large branching-factor, e.g., Chess, and my version of it performed in the top 25% of my class during our year.
